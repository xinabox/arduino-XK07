# Version 1.0.1

## Function Changes
-  The Temperature function call has changed.

    ```c++
    float tempC = SW01.getTemperature_C();
    float tempF = SW01.getTemperature_F();
    ```
    New Function call.
    ```c++
    float tempC = SW01.getTempC();
    float tempF = SW01.getTempF();
    ```

## Added Functionality
- The V1.0.1 Board of the SW01 â˜’CHIP allows I2C Address configuration changes.

  ```c++ 
  bool xSW01::begin(void);
  bool xSW01::begin(uint8_t ADDR);
  ```
  
  Now Accepts a Literal for the I2C Address that is configurable through a solder brigde on the board.
  The Solder briged are read as binary 
  An example for elternal configuration would be as follows:
  
  ```c++ 
  void setup(){
    Wire.begin();
    SW01.begin(SW01_ADDR_01);
  }
  ```
